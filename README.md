- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamdavis345
- 👀 I’m interested in building an alternative to NURBS/Polygon modeling. This solution yields seamless transitions between curved features and requires less of the user (works as polygons too).

Bend Operation:
Don't bend surfaces (by positioning unruly arrays of points), bend space itself and any objects (point/s, line/s, plane/s, and/or solid/s) in it. Beginning with straight objects, repeating the bend operation on consecutive bent results. Space is bent by being fused on to control objects which then move. This bends any target objects in the space.

Formula:
unbent ctrl objects + bent ctrl objects + unbent target objects = bent target objects

2 states, unbent, bent. 
2 lists (of equal length) of paired objects, controls, and targets. 

3 lists input = 1 list output. 

Each control object has a 1 - 100 efficacy variable.

Add-ons to the Bend Operation:
- (Levers: allows you to interact with one location as it relates to objects in another location.)
- (Spin: allows you to swirl space into non-converging layers.)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and help humanity particularly expand the educational and creative potential of computers.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender and wonder if this could be built as an Add-on.
