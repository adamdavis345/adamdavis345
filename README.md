- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamdavis345
- 👀 I’m interested in building an alternative to NURBS and Polygon modeling. This solution will yield more seamless transitions between curved geometric features, and will require less of the user to do so.

- NURBS (Curved rectilinear surfaces informed by an unruly grid of points.) 

Bend Operations: 
Don't bend surfaces (by ), bend space itself and any objects (point/s, line/s, plane/s, and/or solid/s) in it. Space is bent by being fused on to control objects which then move. This bends any target objects in the space.
Formula:unbent ctrl objects + bent ctrl objects + unbent target objects = bent target objects

2 states, unbent, and bent. 2 groups, control, and target. 3 groups input = 1 group output. 

2 lists of objects

(Control objects are paired, and target objects are paired, any point has a corresponding point, any line has a corresponding, and so on...) 

Add-ons to the Bend Operation:
- (Levers: allow you to interact with one location as it relates to objects in another part.)
- - (Spin: allows you to swirl space into nonconverging layers.)



- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender and wonder if this could be built as an Add-on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the educational and creative potential of computers.
