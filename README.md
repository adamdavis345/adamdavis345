- 👋 Hi, I’m @adamdavis345
- 👀 I’m interested in building an alternative to NURBS and Polygon modeling. This solution will yield more seamless transitions between curved geometric features, and will require less of the users time to do so.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Blender and wonder if this could be built as an Add-on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on expanding the educational and creative potential of computers.  
- 📫 How to reach me ...
